# Radio-Coverage-Prediction

Predict receive level for 4G network based on site data base including locations, heights, path loss, bearing angle, distance and satellite images for each location in numerical data.
Labeled data set could be collected from fields and we can use deep learning models to be trained to estimate received level based on the known features
